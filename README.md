# Astar_pathfinder1
This is basic game done using the pygame module with the A* (A star) search algorithm as its principle. 
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart 
algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms.It is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).

Note: Requires a text Editor in order to run the code,  example: Sumblime text or Atom text editor.

This game consists of a grid with numerous blocks with 2 random blocks having a start point and a target point each.
In order to play this game
right click the mouse in order to give random start point and end point(will not work if the starting point and target point are same )
create blockages or walls if needed
press SPACEBAR in order to trigger the animation.
